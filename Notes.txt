Probably going to use this if im running off of my own computer
    from flask import Flask
    from OpenSSL import SSL

    app = Flask(__name__)

    context = SSL.Context(SSL.PROTOCOL_TLSv1_2)
    context.load_cert_chain('path/to/certificate.crt', 'path/to/private.key')

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=443, ssl_context=context)
Ok first thing i need to do is reed up on more secutity
    Obtain an SSL/TLS certificate: You can obtain a free SSL/TLS certificate from Let's Encrypt or purchase one from a certificate authority.

use this to run it http://localhost:5000/
and ittl just work by typin python app.py into terminal

        Rough outline of WindCentral

1.) focus on current python orented. and when done transition to java

2.) Find a different wayof asking for the city, probably some kind of automatic locator.(ask decker probably)

3.) Start with displaying all of the data(Graphs???) matbe some comment system or log in to remind you of the tempature in your email?
Could be useful perhaps you can set it to go off at a certan time. and if it gets to a certan tempature ittl email you.

4.) Make it super easy to unenrole from mailing. I hate mail I dont want

5.) do the entire front end make account things. somehow figure out secutity.
